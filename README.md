## Project Overview
As part of the project, we conducted a comprehensive study on the influence of match days on both Israeli soccer teams and their respective audiences.

To conduct this research, we relied on data sourced from the "Ligat Ha'Al", and applied advanced models joined with machine learning with Python. These models enabled an in-depth data analysis of the various teams and thus we received recommendations for optimal days.

We built our own dataset by using the “Web scraping" technique to extract the required data from the "Transfermrkt" website.

## Data
Despite the existence of numerous data resources for Ligat Ha'Al, we were unable to find any that offered the option to download the data to personal devices. Therefore, we decided to build our own dataset.

We utilized the technique of "web scraping" to extract the required data from the "Transfermrkt" website. Web scraping involves automatically accessing a website's HTML code using a software program or tool to locate and extract relevant data.

After successfully extracting all the necessary data, we adjusted it and combined it into a single dataset, which we then carefully cleaned and organized.
